Many papers that are relevant to understanding the Mercury implementation
are written about the Mercury system itself, usually coauthored by a member
of the Mercury team, and available on the papers page of the Mercury website,
mercurylang.org. However, some not. These are stored on machines that the
Mercury project has no control over, and which may stop hosting those papers
at any time. This has already happened at least once. This repository has
copies of those papers to assure access to them to anyone working on Mercury.

This repository currently contains the following papers, each of which is
relevant to the named module in the Mercury system.
